# CleaningDataCourseProject
Getting and Cleaning Data Course - Final Course Project

To start the analysis, you should download the script to any directory, source the script and call the funcion go.
To run the script you should do, the following Steps:

1 - go to your R console <br>
2 - source("your_chosen_directory/run_analysis.R") <br>
3 - go() # Call the starting function to run the analysis <br>
<br><br>
The script will make all transformations asked in the course project, and creates a TXT file with the write.table() using row.name=FALSE, called <b>project_output.txt</b>, that I'd uploaded on my project submission.<br>

1 - Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.<br>
2 - Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.<br>
3 - Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set<br>
4 - Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.<br>
5 - From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
